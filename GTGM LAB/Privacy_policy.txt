Data protection
We are very pleased that you are interested in our company. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the RIMAS-care GmbH. A use of the internet pages of RIMAS-care GmbH is basically possible without any indication of personal data.

Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the person concerned from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID.

Through the use of cookies, the RIMAS-care GmbH can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.

By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized for the user. As already mentioned, cookies enable us to recognize the users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses cookies does not have to re-enter their access data each time they visit the website because this is done by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in the online shop. The online shop uses a cookie to remember the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart.

The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies.

What cookies are has already been explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain sub-pages, such as the shopping cart from an online shop system, were accessed on our website. Through the conversion cookie, sAlthough both we and Google understand whether a person concerned who came to our website via an AdWords ad generated sales, i.e. completed or canceled a purchase of goods.

The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie are used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. In turn, we use these visit statistics to determine the total number of users who were referred to us via AdWords ads, i.e. to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads for the future .

13. Legal Basis for Processing
Art. 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, such as the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c DS-GVO. In rare cases, the processing of personal data could become necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the person concerned do not prevail. Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the person responsible (recital 47 sentence 2 DS-GVO).

14. Legitimate interests in processing pursued by the controller or a third party
If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO, our legitimate interest is the performance of our business activities for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders.

15. Duration for which personal data will be stored
The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After the deadline, the corresponding data will be routinely deleted if they are no longer required to fulfill the contract or to initiate a contract.

16. Statutory or contractual requirements for providing the personal data; Necessity for the conclusion of the contract; obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of non-provision
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual regulations (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes, in order to conclude a contract, it may be necessary for an affected person to provide us with personal data, which must then be processed by us. For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract with them. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the person concerned could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact one of our employees. Our employee explains to the person concerned whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and what the consequences would be if the personal data were not provided.

17. Existence of automated decision-making
As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.

Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the person concerned from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID.

Through the use of cookies, the RIMAS-care GmbH can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.

For example, the user of a website that uses cookies does not have to re-enter their access data each time they visit the website because this is taken over by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in the online shop. The online shop remembers the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.

Each time one of the individual pages of this website is accessed, which is operated by the person responsible for processing and on which a Facebook componente (Facebook plug-in) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Facebook component to download a representation of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. A general overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE. As part of this technical process, Facebook is informed which specific subpage of our website is visited by the person concerned.

If the person concerned is logged on to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes which specific subpage of our website the person concerned is visiting each time the person concerned calls up our website and for the entire duration of their stay on our website. This information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned to the respective Facebook account of the person concerned by Facebook. If the person concerned clicks one of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button, or if the person concerned makes a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the personal Facebook user account of the person concerned and stores this personal data .

10. Data protection regulations for the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
The person responsible for processing has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the survey, collection and evaluation of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, among other things, data about the website from which a person concerned came to a website (so-called referrer), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising.

The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.

The person responsible for processing uses the addition “_gat._anonymizeIp” for the web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this addition, the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is shortened and anonymized by Google if our Internet pages are accessed from a member state of the European Union or from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other things, to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for us that show the activities on our website, and to provide other services related to the use of our website.

Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is able to analyze the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of this website is called up, which is operated by the person responsible for processing and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is activatedonline shop system on our website. The conversion cookie enables both us and Google to understand whether a data subject who came to our website via an AdWords ad generated revenue, i.e. completed or canceled a purchase of goods.

The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie are used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. In turn, we use these visit statistics to determine the total number of users who were referred to us via AdWords ads, i.e. to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads for the future . Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could be used to identify the data subject.

The conversion cookie is used to store personal information, such as the website visited by the person concerned. Accordingly, each time you visit our website, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass on the personal data collected via the technical process to third parties.

The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.

Furthermore, the data subject has the option of objecting to interest-based advertising by Google. To do this, the person concerned must call up the link www.google.de/settings/ads from each of the Internet browsers they use and make the desired settings there.

Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.
